## Simple Book Management Web App

This is the simple Book Management Web app made with React and Django with the help of Django REST Framework (DRF) for the communication between Frontend and Backend (API).

Following are the functionalities this web app currently offers:
* Adding Books

Following are the features that are currently in development and will come in action soon:
* Editing Book data
* Deleting Books
* Searching Books
* Filtering Books on the basis of language

Note that the UI is too simplistic and bit of ugly. It will be improved in future. Stay tuned...
